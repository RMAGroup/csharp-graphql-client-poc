# Strawberry Shake Graphql Client POC

Investigate using a dotnet based graphql client.

Currently the `skd-function` is based on javascript + graphql codegen + apollo client.

The tooling and setup require time and effort to learn and setup.

Based on: [Get started with Strawberry Shake in a Console application](https://chillicream.com/docs/strawberryshake/v12/get-started/console)
